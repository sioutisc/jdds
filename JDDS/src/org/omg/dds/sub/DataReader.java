/**
 * A DataReader allows the application (1) to declare the data it wishes to
 * receive (i.e., make a subscription) and (2) to access the data received by
 * the attached {@link org.omg.dds.sub.Subscriber}.
 * 
 * A DataReader refers to exactly one {@link org.omg.dds.topic.TopicDescription} (either a
 * {@link org.omg.dds.topic.Topic}, a {@link org.omg.dds.topic.ContentFilteredTopic}, or a {@link org.omg.dds.topic.MultiTopic})
 * that identifies the data to be read. The subscription has a unique
 * resulting type. The data reader may give access to several instances of
 * the resulting type, which can be distinguished from each other by their
 * keys.
 * 
 * All operations except for the inherited operations
 * {@link #setQos(org.omg.dds.core.EntityQos)}, {@link #getQos()},
 * {@link #setListener(java.util.EventListener)}, {@link #getListener()},
 * {@link #enable()}, {@link #getStatusCondition()}, and {@link #close()} may
 * fail with the exception {@link org.omg.dds.core.NotEnabledException}.
 * 
 * All sample-accessing operations, namely all variants of {@link #read()} or
 * {@link #take()}, may fail with the exception
 * {@link org.omg.dds.core.PreconditionNotMetException}.
 * 
 * <b>Access to the Data</b>
 * 
 * Data is made available to the application by the following operations on
 * DataReader objects: {@link #read()}, {@link #take()}, and the other methods
 * beginning with those prefixes.. The general semantics of the "read"
 * operations is that the application only gets access to the corresponding
 * data; the data remains the middleware's responsibility and can be read
 * again. The semantics of the "take" operations is that the application
 * takes full responsibility for the data; that data will no longer be
 * accessible to the DataReader. Consequently, it is possible for a
 * DataReader to access the same sample multiple times but only if all
 * previous accesses were read operations.
 * 
 * Each of these operations returns an ordered collection of {@link org.omg.dds.sub.Sample}s
 * (data values and associated meta-information). Each data value represents
 * an atom of data information (i.e., a value for one instance). This
 * collection may contain samples related to the same or different instances
 * (identified by the key). Multiple samples can refer to the same instance
 * if the settings of the {@link org.omg.dds.core.policy.History} allow for it.
 * 
 * @param <TYPE>    The concrete type of the data to be read.
